Rules & Compliance
Pennsylvania's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandates that Tier 1 RECs be sourced from within the PJM footprint (Page 479).
Load Serving Entities (LSEs) comply by:
Generating power from eligible renewable resources.
Purchasing RECs from qualifying sources.
Using Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs) if they fail to meet their REC obligation (Page 473).
The Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) for Tier 1 RECs in Pennsylvania is $45 per MWh (Page 455).


Supply
In 2023, PA Tier 1 RECs retirements totaled 10,651,534 MWh (Page 460).
Pennsylvania met only 58.8% of its Tier 1 RPS requirement using in-state and PJM-based resources, meaning it relied heavily on out-of-state purchases to meet the rest (Page 487).
Eligible Tier 1 resources include:
Wind
Solar
Low-impact hydro
Biomass
Geothermal (Page 491)


Demand
Pennsylvania’s RPS mandates an increasing share of electricity from Tier 1 resources, creating rising demand (Page 492).
The Tier 1 REC market is undersupplied, increasing demand pressure and making it harder to fulfill obligations (Page 494).
The Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) acts as a price ceiling, preventing excessive REC price spikes (Page 488)

Price Trends
PA Tier 1 REC prices have fluctuated but remain lower than Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) (Page 461).
The PA Tier 1 REC price trend from 2009 to September 2024 is shown in Figure 8-3 (Page 467).
