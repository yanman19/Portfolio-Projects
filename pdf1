# Background Section
background = """Background
Pennsylvania Tier 1 RECs are certificates issued under the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS).
They represent 1 MWh of electricity generated from eligible renewable resources such as solar, wind, geothermal,
low-impact hydropower, biomass (with restrictions), coal mine methane, and fuel cells. Utilities and retail suppliers
must procure a set percentage of these RECs each year to comply with state mandates.

# How Tier 1 RECs Work
rec_work = """How Tier 1 RECs Work
1. Generation & Certification
   - Renewable energy facilities produce electricity and certify each MWh as a REC using systems like PJM’s Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS).
   Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats

2. Compliance for Utilities/Suppliers
   - Each compliance year, utilities must purchase enough Tier 1 RECs to meet mandated percentages under AEPS. If they fall short, they must pay an Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP).
   Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx

3. REC Trading
   - RECs are bought and sold on the open market. Their prices reflect market supply from renewable projects and the demand driven by compliance obligations.
   Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats

4. Compliance & Penalties
   - Failure to meet the required REC procurement results in an ACP, which also serves to cap REC market prices by setting a maximum effective cost.

# Supply and Demand Relationships
supply_demand = """Supply and Demand Relationships
1. Supply Factors
   - Resource Capacity: The total renewable generation capacity determines how many RECs are available.
   - Project Development: New renewable projects affect both current and future REC supplies.
   Source: https://www.eia.gov/

2. Demand Factors
   - Compliance Demand: The annual REC requirement set by AEPS establishes the baseline demand for RECs.
   - Voluntary Purchases: Some organizations buy additional RECs to bolster their renewable energy credentials beyond compliance.
   Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx

3. Market Dynamics
   - REC Pricing: REC prices vary according to the balance between supply and demand, with trends indicating market health.
   - ACP as a Price Cap: The Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) provides an upper limit on REC prices, ensuring cost control for utilities.

# Approach to Understanding Supply-Demand Relationships
approach = """Approach to Understanding Supply-Demand Relationships
- Monitor Capacity Additions: Track news on new renewable projects, regulatory filings, and industry reports to understand changes in REC supply.
  Source: https://www.eia.gov/

- Follow Compliance Requirements: Regularly review updates and policy changes from the Pennsylvania PUC regarding AEPS mandates.
  Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx

- Analyze REC Market Data: Examine REC pricing trends, trading volumes, and market analyses available via PJM’s GATS and industry publications.
  Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats

- Stay Informed on Policy Changes: Keep an eye on legislative and regulatory developments that might affect REC eligibility, ACP levels, or overall market dynamics.
