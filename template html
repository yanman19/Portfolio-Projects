Here's a simple Python file that creates a basic HTTP server serving a "Hello World" HTML page:

```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import socket
import os

# Create an HTML file with "Hello World"
html_content = """<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>"""

# Write the HTML content to a file
with open("hello_world.html", "w") as file:
    file.write(html_content)

# Get the local IP address
hostname = socket.gethostname()
local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)

# Set up a simple HTTP server
port = 8000
server_address = ('', port)  # Empty string means listen on all available interfaces

# Create custom handler that always serves our HTML file
class MyHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.path = "/hello_world.html"
        return SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.do_GET(self)

# Start the server
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHandler)

# Get the absolute file path
file_path = os.path.abspath("hello_world.html")

# Print server info and file path
print(f"Server started at http://{local_ip}:{port}")
print(f"HTML file created at: {file_path}")
print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.")

# Run the server
httpd.serve_forever()
```

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `hello_server.py`)
2. Run it with Python: `python hello_server.py`
3. The terminal will display:
   - The URL where the server is accessible (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8000)
   - The absolute file path of the HTML file
   - Instructions to stop the server

You can access the page from any device on your network by navigating to the displayed URL.

Would you like me to explain how any part of this code works?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
