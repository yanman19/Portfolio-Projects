Here's a modified version that creates a web server accessible to others on your network:

```python
import os
import socket
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import webbrowser
from threading import Thread

# Create HTML content
html_content = """<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>"""

# Write to file
with open("hello_world.html", "w") as file:
    file.write(html_content)

# Get local IP address
hostname = socket.gethostname()
local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)

# Set up server
port = 8000
server_address = ('', port)  # Empty string means listen on all available interfaces

# Handler that serves our HTML file
class MyHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.path = "/hello_world.html"
        return SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.do_GET(self)

# Create and start server
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHandler)
file_path = os.path.abspath("hello_world.html")

print(f"Server started at http://{local_ip}:{port}")
print(f"HTML file created at: {file_path}")
print("Share this link with others on your network: " + f"http://{local_ip}:{port}")
print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.")

# Start the server
httpd.serve_forever()
```

When you run this in a Jupyter notebook:
1. It creates the HTML file
2. Starts a web server on your computer
3. Prints out the URL that you can share with anyone on your local network
4. Others can access your page by typing that URL in their browser

Make sure to keep the notebook running while others are accessing your page.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
