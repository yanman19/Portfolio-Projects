This note summarizes how bilateral physical trading differs between ERCOT and other U.S. ISOs
(PJM, MISO, NYISO, ISO-NE, CAISO). Focus is only on bilateral trades — not ISO market offers.
---
Common to Most Non-ERCOT ISOs
• FERC jurisdiction – Market-based rate (MBR) authority and EQR filings usually required.
• Transmission reservations – Must use OASIS under an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).
• NERC e-Tags – Required for any physical interchange between Balancing Authorities.
---
PJM
• Internal bilateral transactions (IBTs) must be reported to PJM; both parties confirm in PJM systems.
• OASIS used for all transmission reservations, including resale postings.
• Cross-seam scheduling (e.g. with MISO) may apply.
→ Expect additional admin: IBT submissions, e-Tags, PJM settlement credits/charges even for bilats.
---
MISO
• All bilats rely on OASIS and NERC e-Tags; settlement IDs reference the Tag or Schedule ID.
• Dynamic transfers/pseudo-ties have formal BPM rules.
• Complex uplift allocation may touch interchange schedules.
→ Expect tagging paperwork, transmission reservations, and potential uplift exposure.
---
NYISO
• Bilateral schedules submitted to NYISO; firm and non-firm categories with ISO confirmation.
• ISO operations manuals govern curtailments and notifications.
→ ISO visibility and confirmation mandatory—NYISO settles internal bilats directly.
---
ISO-NE
• IBTs must be formally submitted and confirmed by both parties in ISO-NE’s SMS.
• Deadlines are strict (hour-ahead to day-ahead windows).
• Bilateral capacity (CSO) trades tracked by ISO as well.
→ Even purely bilateral energy trades must be entered and confirmed in ISO-NE systems.
---
CAISO
• Participants act through Scheduling Coordinators (SCs); bilateral transfers done via Inter-SC Trades
(ISTs).
• Strict NERC e-Tag timing (T-20 minutes) for intertie flows.
• Dynamic schedules and pseudo-ties subject to CAISO tariff protocols.
→ Requires SC-to-SC structure, tight tag compliance, and ISO acknowledgment.
---
Practical Checklist
1. Confirm FERC MBR authority and EQR obligations.
2. Obtain ISO participant or scheduling rights (for IBT/IST entry).
3. Reserve transmission via OASIS.
4. Create and validate NERC e-Tags within ISO timelines.
5. Submit/confirm internal bilats (IBT/IST) in ISO systems for settlement credit or offset.

Summary
Unlike ERCOT—where bilaterals remain mostly internal and untagged—other ISOs require FERC
authority, tagging, OASIS transmission rights, and ISO confirmations. The “bilateral” layer is more
regulated and administratively visible even when no day-ahead or real-time bids are placed
