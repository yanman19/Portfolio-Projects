Here are several key structural and operational differences to keep in mind when trading physical power in ISOs/RTOs other than ERCOT (e.g. PJM, MISO, NYISO, ISO-NE, CAISO). These differences affect risk, behavior, hedging, settlement, and optimization strategies — so you can’t just “port” ERCOT logic wholesale.

I’ll highlight per ISO (or region) how they differ relative to ERCOT, focusing on aspects relevant to physical dispatch, settlement, and market structure.

Baseline: What’s “ERCOT-like” to compare against

Before diving into differences, here’s a quick sketch of ERCOT’s characteristics (versus many other ISOs):
	•	ERCOT is not FERC-jurisdictional (it sits mostly within Texas, not crossing state lines)  ￼
	•	It has an energy‐only market (no centralized capacity market)
	•	It uses an Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) / scarcity pricing to drive value during tight conditions
	•	Ancillary services and energy are often co‐optimized (in the day-ahead) but not fully in real-time (though changes are coming)  ￼
	•	Uplift / make-whole payments exist but are more limited; scarcity signals are meant to drive cost recovery
	•	Transmission constraints and congestion are priced via locational marginal pricing (LMP)
	•	No forward capacity or multi-year commitments as a market product

So when you move into other ISOs, many of the key differences stem from adding capacity markets, stricter cost recovery / uplift rules, co-optimization regimes, zonal vs nodal design nuances, and different treatment of storage, virtual bidding, etc.

ISO / RTO–by–ISO Differences (relative to ERCOT)

Below I summarize some of the biggest differentiators for PJM, MISO, NYISO, ISO-NE, CAISO, and to a lesser extent SPP. These are not exhaustive, but they cover the most material ones for a physical power trader.

ISO / RTO	Key Differences vs ERCOT	Implications for Physical Power Trading
PJM	• Has a strong forward capacity market (Reliability Pricing Model) with multi-year forward auctions.  ￼ • More rigorous make-whole / uplift / cost recovery frameworks • More constraints and inter-regional flows, with heavy congestion and transmission impacts • More performance obligations for capacity resources (penalties for non-performance) • Virtual bidding is well‐integrated	* You need to manage commitment not only day-ahead / real-time but also your capacity obligations.  * Cost recovery is more baked in, so you must ensure your offers capture full cost (including start-up, no-load) to avoid uneconomic dispatch.  * Congestion and flow impacts can bite your real-time / day-ahead spread.  * Virtual bidding will compress spreads, reduce arbitrage opportunities.
MISO	• Has a Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) / make-whole regime for cost recovery in both DA and RT markets  ￼ • Voluntary locational capacity markets in some zones; no uniform mandatory capacity everywhere  ￼ • More complicated uplift allocation (first pass / second pass) • Dispatch / commitment complexity due to large footprint and multiple zones • Often must bid more conservatively to avoid being “left on the margin”	* You may under-recover on tight hours unless your offer curves are optimized for RSG.  * The optional capacity markets (depending on zone) introduce additional optional obligations or hedging.  * Large network effects—topology, congestion, internal zonal constraints—are more likely to affect your dispatch outcomes.
NYISO	• A hybrid capacity setup — capacity market is mandatory only in constrained zones (e.g. NYC / Lower Hudson Valley)  ￼ • Distinct demand curves for different locational zones in capacity market  ￼ • Heavily constrained urban areas with frequent congestion • Must be more careful about injection into congested zones (mitigation / offer caps)	* If you operate in NYC or other constrained zones, your capacity obligations are binding; elsewhere they might not be.  * Your physical trades need to anticipate local congestion and local capacity costs.  * Your offer strategy must respect possible mitigation or caps in constrained zones.
ISO-NE	• Has a Forward Capacity Auction (FCA) 3 years ahead to procure capacity  ￼ • Historically, energy and ancillary services were not co-optimized in the day-ahead market (though new reforms are being introduced)  ￼ • More frequent out-of-market “supplemental commitments” due to forecast uncertainty • Closer interconnections with neighboring systems (imports) and reliance on imports • High fuel / gas dependence and constraints on pipeline, making tight-hour risk high	* Your risk exposure includes both energy and capacity contract performance. * Uplift / out-of-market actions can distort clearing prices — you’ll need to model their likelihood.  * Because co-optimization is only partially in place, your offers might need to account for ancillary‐energy tradeoffs more manually.  * Interchange / import pricing will affect marginal cost in tight hours.
CAISO	• No centralized capacity market (unlike many eastern ISOs) — resource adequacy is managed differently / via state mechanisms  ￼ • Ancillary service procurement is zonal (i.e. internal to subregions) rather than system-wide • Default Energy Bid (DEB) rules affect bidding (especially for energy storage)  ￼ • Strict state-level mandates (Renewable Portfolio Standards, storage mandates) • FMM / 15-min market (finer granularity) • More explicit state-driven resource adequacy backstops	* Storage & battery strategies need to navigate DEB constraints and SOC expectations.  * Ancillary service awards may depend on local constraints, not just global supply–demand.  * Because there is no capacity market, scarcity pricing and energy market tightness are more essential.  * You may need to account for more frequent intra-hour dispatch adjustments (15-min or 5-min markets).
SPP	• SPP has transitioned to full day-ahead + real-time markets but does not have a capacity market (or at least not a binding one)  ￼ • Its market is somewhat “younger” / simpler relative to PJM / MISO • Less historical liquidity and fewer complex forward commitments • Congestion and uplift tend to be more modest (though growing)	* More similar to ERCOT in being “energy-only,” but still more structured.  * You can rely less on large capacity obligations and focus more on energy arbitrage.  * However, less liquidity in forward markets might limit hedging options.

Other Dimensions / Considerations Across ISOs

Beyond the per-ISO differences, these are cross-cutting dimensions that you must always check when trading in a non-ERCOT ISO:
	1.	Offer / bid rules for start-up, no-load, minimum run / min down / ramp constraints
Many ISOs require that you properly model and include these operational constraints in your bid curves. If your bids are not consistent with your physical capabilities, you might be dispatched into loss or penalized.
	2.	Cost Recovery / Uplift / Make-Whole Mechanisms
In many ISOs, when your market revenues (from energy + ancillary + capacity) do not cover your costs, there are make-whole or uplift rules to compensate. But eligibility, calculation, and priority differ. E.g. MISO’s RSG, PJM’s uplift / operating reserve credits, ISO-NE’s supplemental commitments.  ￼
In ERCOT, the reliance is more on scarcity pricing and less on broad uplift mechanisms.
	3.	Co-optimization of energy & ancillary services
Many ISOs co-optimize energy + reserve (or ancillary) in both day-ahead and real-time, whereas ERCOT currently does so only in the day-ahead and is rolling out real-time co-optimization.  ￼
Where co-optimization exists, the price signals better reflect opportunity costs of shifting between products.
	4.	Virtual / Financial Bidding & Intertemporal Arbitrage
Virtual bidding (e.g. submitting purely financial bids that offset in real-time) is more common and mature in PJM, MISO, ISO-NE etc. These compress spreads and reduce “inefficiencies.” In ERCOT, virtual bidding is more limited (or exists in a different form).  ￼
That means arbitrage opportunities between day-ahead and real-time are tighter elsewhere.
	5.	Transmission / Congestion / Zonal vs Nodal pricing
All major ISOs use nodal (or “locational marginal price”) models, like ERCOT, but the nature, severity, and dynamics of congestion differ. Some ISOs have “zonal aggregates” or internal zonal constraints.
Also, the transmission topology is more complex and inter-regional flows play a bigger role in many ISOs.
	6.	Interchange / Imports / Tie Lines / External Markets
In ISOs like ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM, imports or exports to neighboring markets are common, and traders must consider cross-border flows and external price impacts. ERCOT is relatively isolated (few interconnections).  ￼
	7.	Regulatory / Market Oversight (FERC vs State)
Unlike ERCOT (which is largely governed at the state level), most ISOs/RTOs are FERC-jurisdictional, meaning market rule changes go through FERC processes and subject to more federal oversight.  ￼
	8.	Forward Commitments / Hedging / Bilateral Markets
Many ISOs support long-term forward contracts, bilateral trading, capacity derivatives, etc. You’ll often need to layer hedges over capacity obligations or energy exposure in these markets.
	9.	Operational Reserve / Ancillary Services Product Definitions
The types of reserves (spinning, non-spinning, regulation up/down, voltage support) and their procurement windows differ. Some ISOs procure reserves zonally, or with different lead times, or with more restrictive qualification criteria.
	10.	Scarcity / Price Caps / Penalty Price Regimes
The design of scarcity pricing, penalty pricing, uplift caps, and design of Operating Reserve Demand Curves are often more aggressive / tighter in ERCOT; other ISOs insert more caps or mitigations to prevent extreme volatility.

If you like, I can prepare a side-by-side comparison table (ERCOT vs PJM vs MISO vs NYISO vs ISO-NE vs CAISO) summarizing all these differences in one sheet you can use as a reference. Do you want me to lay that out?
