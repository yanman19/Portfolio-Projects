Excellent — that’s the next layer you really need when moving beyond ERCOT.
In ERCOT, a bilat error is mostly between counterparties. In the FERC-jurisdictional ISOs, mismatched, late, or untagged schedules can trigger ISO-level penalties, imbalance charges, or even NERC violations.

Here’s a summary of penalty exposure for bilateral trades by ISO — focused on mistiming, mismatches, or tagging failures.

⸻

⚡ General Across All Non-ERCOT ISOs
	•	NERC e-Tag compliance:
	•	If your tag isn’t submitted, approved, or updated before the ISO cutoff (usually 20–30 min prior to the hour), the schedule is rejected and flagged as a non-compliant interchange.
	•	Repeated violations → NERC compliance findings (could result in fines on the BA, passed down contractually).
	•	Imbalance energy penalties:
	•	If you deliver less or more than scheduled, the ISO settles the difference at real-time imbalance prices, which can be punitive (e.g., $1000+/MWh during scarcity).
	•	Late or missing confirmation:
	•	In PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, CAISO — unconfirmed or mismatched IBTs/ISTs default to zero schedule, and both counterparties get imbalance charges.
	•	Tag correction timing:
	•	Most ISOs require updates before T-20 or T-30 minutes; editing after the window can trigger automatic curtailment or denial, effectively canceling the transfer.

⸻

PJM
	•	IBT mismatch: If counterparties submit differing MWs or timestamps → PJM auto-rejects the IBT.
	•	Missed tagging: If an external tag is missing or not approved → PJM charges the energy deviation at real-time LMP.
	•	Persistent mismatches: May be escalated as a Tariff Section 10.4 violation, subject to financial penalties or suspension.
	•	Late submission: Missed IBT deadline (often 10:00 EPT for DA, 2 hours prior for RT) → treated as imbalance exposure.

⸻

MISO
	•	Invalid tag or schedule ID: The transaction won’t settle; both sides receive Uninstructed Deviation Charges (UDCs).
	•	Tag correction cutoff: T-20 min; later edits ignored, leading to imbalance settlement.
	•	RSG (Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee) claw-back: If a mismatched tag causes the ISO to redispatch, the participant can lose RSG credits.
	•	Repeated tagging errors: May trigger Market Monitoring notifications and could suspend scheduling privileges.

⸻

NYISO
	•	Late or incorrect bilateral submissions: NYISO’s Day-Ahead Bilateral (DAB) and Hour-Ahead Bilateral (HAB) deadlines are enforced strictly — missed = no schedule.
	•	Underdelivery: Charged at real-time LMP + penalty adder.
	•	Unverified tags: ISO can cancel interchange and apply deviation penalties under OATT Attachment M.
	•	Data errors: Repeated mismatches between participants → flagged by the ISO and can lead to market suspension hearings.

⸻

ISO-NE
	•	IBT deadline: Both counterparties must confirm before ISO-NE’s daily cutoff (normally 4 p.m. ET for DA, 1 hour prior for RT). Missed → not recognized.
	•	Discrepancies: MW or time mismatches = auto-rejection.
	•	Failure to meet schedule: Deviations settled at RT LMP with Deviation Charge.
	•	Chronic timing errors: Can violate Market Rule 1, Section III.1.10, exposing you to ISO enforcement actions.

⸻

CAISO
	•	e-Tag cutoff: T-20 min firm — CAISO will not accept a tag or correction after that.
	•	Scheduling Coordinator (SC) obligations:
	•	SCs face financial imbalance penalties and possible Performance Penalties for persistent late tags.
	•	Non-compliant SCs risk suspension from CAISO scheduling.
	•	Dynamic schedule mismatch: If your actual MWs deviate from approved dynamic profile → Uninstructed Deviation Penalty (UDP) applies.
	•	Missed intertie window: Lost opportunity; no back-scheduling allowed.

Practical Summary of Penalty Types

Penalty Type	Where It Applies	Typical Impact
e-Tag late/invalid	All except ERCOT	Schedule rejection; imbalance settlement
IBT/IST mismatch	PJM, ISO-NE, CAISO	Auto-reject; deviation charge
Late submission	PJM, NYISO, ISO-NE	Treated as 0 MW; imbalance charge
Uninstructed deviation	CAISO, MISO	Financial penalty (per MWh deviation)
NERC violation	All (via BA)	Compliance fine passed to participant
Market suspension	Any repeated offender	Temporary loss of scheduling rights

Would you like me to add this penalty section into your PDF (as an updated version, still in bullet form, consistent with the prior style)?
I can label it “Penalty & Compliance Exposure” and append it right after the Practical Checklist.
