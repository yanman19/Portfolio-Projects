Here’s a clear, concise breakdown of the key events and reasons behind the denial of the Talen–PJM ISA:

⸻

What Happened with the Talen–PJM ISA
	•	PJM filed an amended Interconnection Service Agreement (ISA) in June 2024 to increase behind-the-meter power from Susquehanna nuclear from 300 MW to 480 MW for an AWS data center.  ￼
	•	FERC rejected the non‑conforming ISA on November 1, 2024 (2–1 vote). It held that PJM failed to meet its high burden under Order 2003 to justify deviations from the pro forma ISA.  ￼
	•	Main reasons cited by FERC (Christie & See):
	•	PJM did not demonstrate specific reliability concerns, novel legal issues, or unique factors requiring the change.
	•	The non‑conforming provisions mirrored generic PJM guidance, raising questions about whether they would apply universally—suggesting inappropriate tariff bypass.  ￼
	•	Stakeholder objections
	•	AEP and Exelon argued this would shift up to $140 million/year in costs to other ratepayers and distort capacity and transmission cost allocation.  ￼
	•	Chair Phillips (dissenting):
	•	Argued this was a “first-of-its-kind” co-location with clear reliability and national security implications, especially given growing AI demand. He would have accepted the ISA with conditions and transparency.  ￼
	•	FERC held a technical conference on large co-located loads on November 1, 2024, but still rejected the ISA pending more specific tariff reforms via stakeholder process.  ￼
	•	Rehearing denied April 10, 2025:
FERC reaffirmed its position, again citing failure to justify non‑conforming provisions. But clarified this decision doesn’t preclude future similar filings with better justification.  ￼
	•	Talen appealed to the Fifth Circuit and continues PPA deliveries under the existing 300 MW ISA.  ￼

📝 Summary
	•	PJM sought a 480 MW non-pro forma ISA for AWS at Susquehanna.
	•	FERC rejected it twice, citing lack of justification and concerns about precedent and fairness.
	•	Major opponents argued cost-shifting and market disruption.
	•	Chair dissent highlighted national security and reliability.
	•	Talen has appealed and continues under existing 300 MW ISA.
