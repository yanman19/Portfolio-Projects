Here’s a clean, copy-paste-ready email blurb with a clear top-level theme and tight, simple bullets underneath.

⸻

Theme: Bearish View on PJM West Hub Spark Spread vs Henry Hub
	•	Market is Pricing a Premium
	•	PJM West Hub sparks appear to be holding roughly a $10 premium relative to Henry Hub.
	•	This premium looks stretched versus fundamentals at current information levels.
	•	Stack Changes (Supply Side)
	•	Year-over-year stack is loosening, not tightening.
	•	~1 GW of new gas capacity expected to come online earlier this calendar year.
	•	Incremental supply reduces system tightness versus last summer.
	•	Load Growth Assumptions
	•	Base case load growth: ~2 GW YoY (Cal ’25 observed).
	•	Worst-case assumption: ~3% load growth.
	•	Even at 3%, load growth does not fully offset new supply additions.
	•	Load growth may accelerate longer term, but near-term assumptions do not justify current pricing.
	•	Weather Dependency
	•	Current pricing implies an 80th–90th percentile summer weather scenario.
	•	No weather signal or forward justification for this level of heat today.
	•	To realize current pricing levels, the system would require a very hot summer.
	•	Historical Context
	•	Summer last year showed similar pricing performance without extreme weather.
	•	July was the 5th hottest in the past 35 years, but August was mild.
	•	Even then, historical clears do not support today’s forward premium.
	•	Forward vs Historical Clears
	•	Current forwards are well above historical clearance levels.
	•	While structural load growth exists, it is insufficient to justify the magnitude of the premium being priced.
	•	Bottom Line
	•	Under normal weather assumptions, the system should be less tight YoY.
	•	The current spark spread premium appears overextended relative to fundamentals.
	•	Downside risk exists if weather fails to realize implied extremes.

If you want, I can:
	•	Tighten this further into a one-screen trader blurb, or
	•	Re-write it in a more neutral / research-desk tone, or
	•	Align the bullets exactly to the charts you plan to include (stack, load, weather percentiles, clears).
