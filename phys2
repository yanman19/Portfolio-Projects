# Physical Bilateral Trading Across US ISOs

## A Banking Perspective on Market Entry and Key Differences

-----

## ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas)

### Regulatory Jurisdiction

- **NOT under FERC jurisdiction** - Regulated by Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and Texas Legislature
- Only ISO in continental US not subject to FERC oversight
- Operates entirely within Texas to avoid interstate commerce rules
- This is ERCOT’s most distinctive characteristic with major implications

### Market Structure Fundamentals

- **Energy-only market** - No capacity market, leading to higher price volatility and potential for significant price spikes
- Nodal market with Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP)
- Largely isolated from other US grids (minimal interconnections)
- Real-time co-optimization of energy and ancillary services

### Registration Requirements for Banks

- Register as **Market Participant** with ERCOT
- Establish relationship with a **Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE)** or become one yourself
- Submit Market Participant Agreement and associated documentation
- Provide financial information and creditworthiness documentation
- Complete ERCOT market training requirements
- Timeline: Typically 30-60 days for approval

### Credit and Collateral

- Credit requirements determined by exposure calculations
- May need to post collateral via letter of credit or cash
- Credit monitoring is ongoing with potential for additional collateral calls
- QSE is responsible for financial settlement, so bank must maintain credit with QSE

### Key Operational Considerations

- **Bilateral schedules** submitted through your QSE
- Must understand day-ahead and real-time market timelines
- Balance schedules must be submitted to avoid imbalance charges
- No transmission reservations required for intra-ERCOT transactions

### Critical Risk Factors for Banks

- **Scarcity pricing can be extreme** - Prices can reach $5,000/MWh or higher during shortage conditions
- Weather volatility (extreme heat/cold) creates significant price risk
- No capacity market means all reliability value captured in energy prices
- Limited interconnections mean no easy import options during tight conditions
- Real-time price risk if schedules don’t balance with actual delivery
- Regulatory uncertainty - ERCOT market design continues to evolve post-Winter Storm Uri
- Must carefully manage credit exposure with counterparties given price volatility
