Below is the clean, simple, scientific-method-style outline of the project you described. It’s structured so you can hand it to anyone and they’ll understand the exact steps required to build the full Lower-48 monthly power-burn model.

⸻

**Lower-48 Monthly Gas Burn / Power Burn Forecasting Model

(Bottom-Up Renewable + Thermal Stack Framework)**

⸻

1. Objective

Create a bottom-up, monthly-granular, Lower-48 model that forecasts gas burn for power by explicitly modeling:
	1.	The full generating stack (renewables + thermal) over time.
	2.	The generation output of each resource class.
	3.	The thermal split between coal / gas / oil.
	4.	The net gas burn that results after all other supply sources are accounted for.
	5.	A forward load forecast to balance total generation demand.
	6.	A final monthly Bcf gas burn projection feeding into the storage model for trading decisions.

⸻

2. Core Principle

Move from a top-down regression framework (weather → gas share → burn)
→ to a bottom-up physical modeling framework (capacity → CF → generation → thermal stack → gas burn).
This enables toggling of real-world drivers (wind additions, retirements, coal/gas switching, outages, etc).

⸻

A. SUPPLY-SIDE MODEL

⸻

3. Build the Forward Capacity Stack

3.1 Current Installed Capacity (baseline)

Compile current Lower-48 capacity for:
	•	Wind
	•	Solar
	•	Batteries (charging/discharging logic later)
	•	Hydro
	•	Nuclear
	•	Coal
	•	Gas
	•	Oil
(Optionally biomass + “other” buckets)

3.2 Forward Capacity Additions / Retirements

For each month going forward:
	•	Scheduled wind/solar additions
	•	Coal retirement schedule
	•	New gas builds (if any)
	•	Nuclear outages / restarts / long-term offline assumptions
	•	Hydro seasonal expectations
→ Produce a capacity-by-resource-by-month dataset.

⸻

4. Convert Capacity Into Generation (Renewables + Nuclear + Hydro)

4.1 Seasonalized Capacity Factors

For each resource:
	•	Wind CF by month
	•	Solar CF by month
	•	Battery round-trip efficiency + assumed dispatch
	•	Hydro seasonal patterns
	•	Nuclear baseline CF minus planned outage schedule

4.2 Multiply Capacity × CF

For each month, calculate expected GWh generated by:
	•	Wind
	•	Solar
	•	Hydro
	•	Nuclear
	•	Battery discharge contributions
→ Sum to get non-thermal generation each month.

⸻

5. Determine Total Required Thermal Generation

Thermal generation = Total load – (renewables + nuclear + hydro + battery discharge)

Load must be separately forecasted (see Section B).

⸻

6. Split Thermal Generation Into Coal / Gas / Oil

6.1 Create a Coal/Gas/Oil Allocation Framework

Requires one of the following approaches:
	•	Rolling multi-year seasonal averages of thermal share
	•	Forward-looking price-based coal-to-gas switching model
	•	Coal retirement schedule adjustments
	•	Seasonal constraints (cold-weather coal availability, maintenance cycles)

Goal: produce monthly percentages:
	•	% Coal
	•	% Gas
	•	% Oil

6.2 Apply the Percentages to Total Thermal Generation

→ Yields coal GWh, gas GWh, oil GWh each month.

⸻

7. Convert Gas GWh to Bcf

Using a standardized heat-rate assumption (or a dynamic heat-rate curve):
	•	Gas_GWh × heat_rate → mmBtu → Bcf

This produces the monthly Lower-48 gas burn forecast.

⸻

B. DEMAND-SIDE MODEL

⸻

8. Build a Forward Load Forecast

8.1 Baseline Load

Use historical monthly load patterns for the Lower-48:
	•	Structural load growth (data centers, electrification)
	•	Regionally weighted growth to form a national total

8.2 Forward Load Curve

Combine:
	•	Trend growth assumptions
	•	Known industrial additions / retirements
	•	Seasonal shapes
	•	Price elasticity (optional)
→ Generate monthly total system load.

⸻

C. INTEGRATION INTO GAS MARKET MODEL

⸻

9. Feed Monthly Gas Burn into Storage Model

Take monthly Bcf power-burn outputs and plug them into the existing fundamental storage model to update:
	•	Monthly expected injections/withdrawals
	•	End-of-month storage levels
	•	Carry structure
	•	Contango/backwardation pressure

⸻

10. Evaluate Market Pricing vs Fundamentals

Compare the model’s required injections/withdrawals with:
	•	Current strip spreads
	•	Current market-implied burn assumptions
	•	Weather sensitivity bands

This enables:
	•	Summer/winter shape trades
	•	Calendar spreads
	•	Regional spreads (via thermal splits / load differences)
	•	Outright directional bets when mispriced

⸻

D. PROJECT EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

⸻

11. Step-By-Step Build Plan (Scientific-Method Style)
	1.	Define the stack: collect current installed capacity for all fuels.
	2.	Map future capacity: additions + retirements by month.
	3.	Create capacity factor library: seasonal CF curves for wind/solar/hydro/nuke.
	4.	Convert capacity → generation for all non-thermal sources.
	5.	Build the load forecast: load growth assumption + seasonal shape.
	6.	Calculate required thermal generation each month.
	7.	Allocate thermal stack into coal/gas/oil using chosen methodology.
	8.	Convert gas generation → Bcf using heat-rate assumptions.
	9.	Output final monthly Lower-48 gas burn forecast.
	10.	Integrate forecast into storage model to determine net balances.
	11.	Run scenario toggles: wind growth ↑/↓, coal retirements, outages, price-driven switching, etc.
	12.	Use results to identify trades based on expected vs implied gas-burn values.

⸻

12. End Goal

A robust bottom-up, toggle-driven power burn model that produces a monthly Lower-48 Bcf forecast and seamlessly feeds into your storage model, enabling more accurate trading decisions and reducing the error introduced by top-down regressions or stack-ratio assumptions.

⸻

If you want, I can now:
1) Convert this into a folder structure & file blueprint for coding;
2) Build the full Python model;
3) Generate the data schemas;
4) Create a Panel/Dash dashboard for toggling assumptions.
