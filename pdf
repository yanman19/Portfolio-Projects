    "Background\n"
    "Pennsylvania Tier 1 RECs are certificates issued under the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS). "
    "They represent 1 MWh of electricity generated from eligible renewable resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, "
    "low-impact hydropower, biomass (with restrictions), coal mine methane, and fuel cells. Utilities and retail suppliers "
    "must procure a set percentage of these RECs each year to comply with state mandates.\n"

# How Tier 1 RECs Work Section

    "How Tier 1 RECs Work\n"
    "1. Generation & Certification\n"
    "   - Renewable energy facilities produce electricity and certify each MWh as a REC using systems like PJM’s Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS).\n"
    "   Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats\n\n"
    "2. Compliance for Utilities/Suppliers\n"
    "   - Each compliance year, utilities must purchase enough Tier 1 RECs to meet mandated percentages under AEPS. If they fall short, they must pay an Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP).\n"
    "   Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx\n\n"
    "3. REC Trading\n"
    "   - RECs are bought and sold on the open market. Their prices reflect market supply from renewable projects and the demand driven by compliance obligations.\n"
    "   Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats\n\n"
    "4. Compliance & Penalties\n"
    "   - Failure to meet the required REC procurement results in an ACP, which also serves to cap REC market prices by setting a maximum effective cost.\n"

    "Supply and Demand Relationships\n"
    "1. Supply Factors\n"
    "   - Resource Capacity: The total renewable generation capacity determines how many RECs are available.\n"
    "   - Project Development: New renewable projects affect both current and future REC supplies.\n"
    "   Source: https://www.eia.gov/\n\n"
    "2. Demand Factors\n"
    "   - Compliance Demand: The annual REC requirement set by AEPS establishes the baseline demand for RECs.\n"
    "   - Voluntary Purchases: Some organizations buy additional RECs to bolster their renewable energy credentials beyond compliance.\n"
    "   Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx\n\n"
    "3. Market Dynamics\n"
    "   - REC Pricing: REC prices vary according to the balance between supply and demand, with trends indicating market health.\n"
    "   - ACP as a Price Cap: The Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) provides an upper limit on REC prices, ensuring cost control for utilities.\n"

    "Approach to Understanding Supply-Demand Relationships\n"
    "- Monitor Capacity Additions: Track news on new renewable projects, regulatory filings, and industry reports to understand changes in REC supply.\n"
    "  Source: https://www.eia.gov/\n\n"
    "- Follow Compliance Requirements: Regularly review updates and policy changes from the Pennsylvania PUC regarding AEPS mandates.\n"
    "  Source: https://www.puc.pa.gov/Energy/EnergyPrograms/Pages/AlternativeEnergyPortfolioStandard.aspx\n\n"
    "- Analyze REC Market Data: Examine REC pricing trends, trading volumes, and market analyses available via PJM’s GATS and industry publications.\n"
    "  Source: https://www.pjm.com/gats\n\n"
    "- Stay Informed on Policy Changes: Keep an eye on legislative and regulatory developments that might affect REC eligibility, ACP levels, or overall market dynamics.\n"
