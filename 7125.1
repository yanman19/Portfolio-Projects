Why Comanche (ERCOT) Is Different from Talen (PJM)
	•	No FERC Oversight in ERCOT
ERCOT isn’t regulated by FERC like PJM is, so deals like Comanche–data center don’t need federal approval.

	•	New Texas Law (SB 6) Helps
Texas passed Senate Bill 6 in June 2025, making it easier for large loads (like data centers) to connect directly to power plants (like Comanche).

	•	Behind-the-Meter Deals Are Legal
In ERCOT, a power plant can sell directly to a data center using a private wire (behind the meter), avoiding transmission costs — if it doesn’t affect the grid.

	•	No Capacity Market to Disrupt
ERCOT doesn’t have a capacity market like PJM, so Comanche isn’t losing payments or harming the broader market by serving a private customer.

	•	SB 6 Requires Reliability Protections
If Comanche powers a data center directly, SB 6 allows ERCOT to require backup generation or emergency curtailment.

⸻

In short:
Texas made this kind of deal easier.
No federal approval needed.
A new law (SB 6) gives clear rules.
Comanche can power a data center directly if it follows reliability and cost rules.
