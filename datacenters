### Regional capacity distribution by 2030

The **Northern Virginia Dominion zone will dominate** with approximately 13,000 MW (62% of regional capacity), driven by Loudoun County’s position as the global data center capital.  **Pennsylvania is emerging as a major secondary hub** with 3,000 MW projected, while Ohio contributes 3,500 MW primarily around Columbus and Cincinnati metro areas.

## Market transformation and grid impact

This dramatic 10x growth from 2020 to 2030 represents a **fundamental transformation of the PJM grid**.  Data centers have evolved from 21% of Dominion Virginia’s sales in 2022 to a projected dominant load type.   The growth trajectory shows accelerating momentum, with **compound annual growth rates of 20.8% for 2020-2025 increasing to 30.5% for 2026-2030** as AI infrastructure deployment intensifies.

**Power constraints are becoming the primary limiting factor**, particularly in Northern Virginia, driving geographic expansion to secondary markets. The announced pipeline of over $200 billion in investments  faces execution risk from transmission capacity, utility interconnection queues, and nuclear power availability  - making the difference between announced and operational capacity increasingly critical for market analysis.
