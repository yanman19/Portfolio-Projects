I'll help you create a new product that represents the difference between two product prices for each contract. Let me write the code for you.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming your dataframe is named 'df' and has the structure:
# - Date as index
# - 'product' column with product names
# - 'contract' column with contract names like 'Aug25', 'Jan34', etc.
# - 'price' column with the price values

# First, let's create a function to compute the difference
def create_product_spreads(df, product1, product2, new_product_name=None):
    """
    Create a new product that represents the difference between two product prices
    for each contract and date.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    df : pandas DataFrame
        The input dataframe with date index, product, contract, and price columns
    product1 : str
        First product name
    product2 : str
        Second product name
    new_product_name : str, optional
        Name for the new product. If None, will use '{product1}_{product2}_spread'
        
    Returns:
    --------
    pandas DataFrame
        Original dataframe with new product rows added
    """
    if new_product_name is None:
        new_product_name = f"{product1}_{product2}_spread"
    
    # Create a copy of the dataframe to avoid modifying the original
    result_df = df.copy()
    
    # Pivot the data to get prices for each product-contract combination by date
    pivot_df = df.pivot_table(index=df.index, columns=['product', 'contract'], values='price')
    
    # Get unique contracts
    contracts = df['contract'].unique()
    
    # For each contract, calculate the spread
    new_rows = []
    for contract in contracts:
        try:
            # Check if both products exist for this contract
            if (product1, contract) in pivot_df.columns and (product2, contract) in pivot_df.columns:
                # Calculate the spread for each date
                for date in pivot_df.index:
                    price1 = pivot_df.loc[date, (product1, contract)]
                    price2 = pivot_df.loc[date, (product2, contract)]
                    
                    # Only add if both prices exist
                    if not pd.isna(price1) and not pd.isna(price2):
                        spread = price1 - price2
                        new_rows.append({
                            'product': new_product_name,
                            'contract': contract,
                            'price': spread
                        })
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing contract {contract}: {e}")
    
    # Create a dataframe with the new rows
    new_df = pd.DataFrame(new_rows, index=pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(
        [(date, new_product_name, contract) for date, _, contract in 
         [(date, new_product_name, contract) for date in pivot_df.index for contract in [row['contract'] for row in new_rows]]],
        names=[df.index.name, 'product', 'contract']))
    
    # Set the index to match the original dataframe
    new_df.reset_index(inplace=True)
    new_df.set_index(df.index.name, inplace=True)
    
    # Concatenate the original dataframe with the new rows
    result_df = pd.concat([result_df, new_df])
    
    return result_df

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'df' is your dataframe
# For example, to create a spread between 'ProductA' and 'ProductB'
# df_with_spreads = create_product_spreads(df, 'ProductA', 'ProductB', 'ProductA_minus_ProductB')

# To create spreads for multiple product pairs:
def create_multiple_spreads(df, product_pairs):
    """
    Create multiple spreads from a list of product pairs
    
    Parameters:
    -----------

        The input dataframe
    product_pairs : list of tuples
        List of (product1, product2, new_name) tuples
        
    Returns:

    result = df.copy()
    for product1, product2, new_name in product_pairs:
        result = create_product_spreads(result, product1, product2, new_name)
    return result

# Example usage:
# product_pairs = [
#     ('ProductA', 'ProductB', 'A_minus_B'),
#     ('ProductC', 'ProductD', 'C_minus_D')
# ]
# final_df = create_multiple_spreads(df, product_pairs)
```

This code provides a flexible solution for creating price spreads between products. Here's how to use it:

1. The `create_product_spreads` function calculates the difference between two products for each contract and date.
2. The `create_multiple_spreads` function allows you to create multiple spreads in one go.

To use this code, you would:
1. Replace 'ProductA' and 'ProductB' with your actual product names
2. If you have multiple spreads to create, define them in the product_pairs list
3. Make sure your dataframe has the expected structure with date index, product, contract, and price columns

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code or adapt it further to your exact data structure?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
